GTK made Qt

Souce code from the gqt project

has been merged, for more detalis, see README.gqt

This is a hack to demonstrate that the GTK+ APIs can be implemented by using Qt.

This is very far from production ready. Feel free to improve!


BUILDING

run qmake-qt5 gtk-made-qt.pro
make


BUILD+TEST

For automatic building and testing an application, run the bgqt.sh script
with the name of one of the tests in the "examples" directory.

for example: 
./bgqt.sh button

will first build the headers and library and then compile examples/button.c
and lastly execute the examples/button binary.

For comparison, there is also a bgtk.sh script which builds the same examples using GTK.
